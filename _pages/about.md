I am a Tobin Center Pre-Doctoral Fellow at Yale University. My research agenda focuses on education, health, and development. In the past, I worked as a Short Term Consultant for the Development Impact department (DIME) at the World Bank. I was also a research assistant at Harvard Kennedy School, the United Nations Development Programme, Colombia's Central Bank, and EAFIT University.

Here is a copy of my [CV](/files/CV_PabloUribe.pdf).
